            <p>I am focused on earning a degree in Software Engineering at International University Center (Uninter). I am
                tapping the self-discipline, long-term commitment, and attention to detail that helped me become a
                professional
                violinist to pursue a new career in business technology and marketing. After receiving my bachelor's from
                the
                State University of Paraná (UNESPAR) in 2016, I participated in research projects and taught string
                instruments
                as a volunteer teacher at the Paraná University of Technology (UTFPR). I have volunteer field experience
                supporting families, parents and teenagers struggling with addiction.</p>
